    "Popular datasets like [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), [Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris), and [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) are great for learning, because you can learn a lot from the detailed analyses that many people have written using them.

This is because it is incredibly difficult to discover something that has not already been found by thousands of people before you.  \n",
