    "### Use interesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular datasets like [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), [Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris), and [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) are great for learning, because you can learn a lot from the detailed analyses that many people have written using them.  However, they are not good candidates for building your portfolio project.  This is because it is incredibly difficult to discover something that has not already been found by thousands of people before you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using one of these popular datasets, you should look for a dataset that hasn't been overly explored, so you are more likely to find something that is interesting and novel.  Having a project topic that feels unique is important: it demonstrates to a potential employer that you can proactively find opportunities to leverage analyze unstructured data, in a way that results in well-informed, data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your project should inspire you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a project that is interesting to you personally.  This way, you're more likely to complete your project.  If you're excited about it, you're more likely to be genuinely engaging when you talk about it in a job interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The success of your project should not depend on what you find.\n",

    "Jason Goodman, a Data Scientist at Airbnb, has a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@jasonkgoodman/advice-on-building-data-portfolio-projects-c5f96d8a0627) with practical advice for building DS portfolio projects.  In the post, he descibes a project in college where he investigated the impact of fraud on neighboring nonprofits.  Unfortunately, he discovered that fraud had no impact, which ultimately resulted in a project that was not very interesting.\n",
