    "\n",
    "In the previous two lessons, we learned how to model the temporally-dependent nature of time series through trend and seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn how to model the serially-dependent nature of time series, how the past can affect the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cycles #\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to trend and seasonality, time series can display **cyclic** behavior. Cycles are fluctuations in a time series associated with how the value in a series at one time depends on values at previous times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic behavior is characteristic of a system that reacts on itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What distinguishes cycles from seasons is irregularity. Cycles might be irregular either in duration or in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img>examples of cyclic behavior</img>\n",

    "- business cycles\n",
    "- predator-prey cycles\n",
    "- sunspot cycles\n",
    "- flu cycles\n",
    "- chemical cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible for series to have trend and seasonality in addition to cyclic behavior, though distinguishing the three can sometimes be difficult: very long cycles can resemble trend and very regular cycles can resemble seasons. For the purposes of creating a forecasting model, however, the distinction may not matter so long as you're able to capture the behavior of the series through the forecasting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features we created for trend and seasonality are sometimes called *deterministic*. (You may have noticed they came from the `deterministic` module in statsmodels.) A deterministic feature doesn't need to be forecast: it's values are completely determined ahead of time. The trend and seasonality features are deterministic because they only depend on the calendar, which is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "How something is presently can often tell you a lot about what it will be like in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also happen that the fluctations don't decay back towards a mean. In this case, you have a *highly-persistant* series. We'll discuss how to handle these kinds of series in Lesson 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Serial Dependence and Lag Features #\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common kind of nondeterministic feature is the target itself, or rather, values of the target from the past. If you wanted to predict the size of a fish population this year, you could include as a predictor the size of the population the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>table</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we've actually created a new column with shifted values of `Population`. The target has now re-entered the model as a feature. Features created from time-shifted series in this way are called **lag** features. Most nondeterministic features are lag features.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to determine if your target has a temporal relationship to a feature is by plotting it against the lagged feature.\n",

    "Correlation of a time series with past-values of itself is called *autocorrelation*. A plot of a series' autocorrelation as a function of the lag is called an *ACF plot*. Correlation of a time series with another time series is called *cross-correlation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of plots you can use to determine which lag features to create from the target. The autocorrelation plot simply shows you the correlation a series has with each of its lags.\n",

For example, online product reviews might be a leading indicator of future business success.\n",
