    "\n",
    "A **time series** is a set of observations taken over time. Typically, the observations are taken over some common period, like daily or monthly. In this course, we'll represent a time series as Pandas `Series` object with either a `PeriodIndex` or a `DatetimeIndex`. Here are a few entries from a time series with monthly automobiles sales in the United States:\n",

    "A time series, on the other hand, can contain additional information about itself, either directly through the time index or through sequences of association in it's values. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, there are two properties that are characteristic of time series:\n",
    "- **Time dependence**: the value of an observation can be predicted by the time it occured. Trend (Lesson 2) and seasonality (Lesson 3) are typical kinds of time dependence.\n",
    "- **Serial dependence**: the value of an observation can be predicted from previous observations. Autocorrelation (Lesson 4) is a typical kind of serial dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to separate the kinds of dependence present in a time series into component series. This shows the *Automobile Sales* series decomposed into time-dependent trend and seasonal series together with a residual series having some (mild) autocorrelation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img>auto decomp</img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding these components together would give us the original series again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many time series in real-world applications will have both time dependence and serial dependence. A series that has neither appears as noise. These kinds of dependence provide a rich source of information that we can use to understand the behavior of a time series. In the first few lessons of this course, we'll learn how to model them through feature engineering to accomplish our task: forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forecasting #\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting is different from other machine learning tasks and will require some modifications to common practices like inference, training, and validation. The reason is that the time and serial dependence often present in time series violate the usual properties we require of our data samples: that they are *independent and identically distributed* (or *iid.*). (Recall that this means that they have been selected at random all from the same source or generating process, basically.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- serial dependence violates independence\n",
    "- time dependence violates identically distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "Serial dependence violates the requirement that observations be independent. Among other problems, this puts us in danger of *data leaks* when we are creating data splits or engineering features through *lookahead*, using information from the future that wouldn't be available at the time of the forecast. (See our lesson on [Data Leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/data-leakage) for more.) Data leakage is an especially common way to be misled about the quality of a forecasting model. The ways it can occur can be subtle, and we'll take special care in this course in learning how to avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time dependence means the loss of the \"identically distributed\" property, which is perhaps more serious. In the usual machine learning world of identically distributed data, regression is essentially the problem of curve-fitting, or of *interpolating* between points in the training set in a way that matches the true data distribution. In forecasting, we instead have the problem of *extrapolating* predictions to a potentially very different data distribution in the future.\n",

    "Fitting a trendline to *Automobile Sales*. Where should the trend go in the future?\n",
    "</img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation problem is how to \"fill in the blanks\" between the points in the training set. But in forecasting, there's no \"next point\" to connect the curve to, so how can we know where the curve should go next?\n",
