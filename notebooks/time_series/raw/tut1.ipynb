    "# What is a Time Series? #\n",
    "\n",
    "A **time series** is simply a set of observations recorded over time. Typically, the observations are taken over some common period, like daily or monthly, which we refer to as the \"frequency\" of the series. In this course, we'll represent a time series as a Pandas `Series` object with either a `PeriodIndex` (spans of time) or a `DatetimeIndex` (instants in time).\n",

    "# Time Dependence and Serial Dependence #\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series' index is no less important than its observations. This indexing by time is what allows time series a characteristically rich behavior. It does this in two ways: first, by allowing a relationship between the times in the index and the values of the observations -- a **time dependence**; and, second, by allowing a relationship among observations through the ordering it imposes -- a **serial dependence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rephrasing, a time series exhibits:\n",
    "- **time dependence** if the value of an observation can be predicted from the time it occured, and,\n",
    "- **serial dependence** if the value of an observation can be predicted from previous observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, this means we can model time dependence by using the time index as a feature and serial dependence by using \"lagged\" copies of the observations as features. (We'll learn how in future lessons.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization helps us to know what kinds of relationships we should try to model. By plotting a time series' observations against its index, we can see its time dependence. By plotting a time series' observations against past observations, we can see its serial dependence.\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, some pattern in a time series can appear as both time dependence and serial dependence. The trend in the *Auto Sales* series, for instance, appears both as the upward movement in the figure on the left and as the strong linear correlation in the figure on the right. This is just to say that these two kinds of dependence aren't entirely distinct (which sometimes makes modeling choices difficult), though it is possible to have one without the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and serial dependence are fundamental to time series and are what make forecasting different from and uniquely challenging among machine learning tasks. Time and serial dependence will inform almost everything we do in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Series Decomposition and Additive Models #\n",
    "\n",
    "A profitable strategy when working with a time series is to separate out its various patterns of dependence. *Trend* and *seasonality* are two kinds of time dependence especially common in business time series. (We'll learn more about them in Lessons 2 and 3.) They give the \"Season-Trend\" decomposition:\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>Season-Trend decomposition of the <em>Auto Sales</em> time series. The \"residuals\" are another name for the error component (the \"left-over\" part).\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of decomposition is an *additive* decomposition: add up all the components and you get back the original series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that a time series can be represented as a sum of components motivates most of the models we'll create in this course. The *Prophet* algorithm we use in this lesson models a time series as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "target = trend + seasonality + holidays + error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `error` is just anything that wasn't captured by the other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future lessons, we'll create models similar to the Prophet model through a combination of feature engineering and linear regression. We'll also see how we can use this additive decomposition strategy to create *hybrid models* that can accomodate combinations of algorithms, like XGBoost stacked on top of a trend model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example - Tunnel Traffic #\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get a start on how to approach these problems by applying Facebook's Prophet forecaster to the *Tunnel Traffic* dataset. *Tunnel Traffic* is a time series describing the number of vehicles traveling through the Baregg Tunnel in Switzerland each day from November 2003 to November 2005. The hidden cell sets up the example."
