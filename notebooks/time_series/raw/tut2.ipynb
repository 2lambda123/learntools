    "# What is Trend? #\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trend** component of a time series represents a persistent, long-term change in the mean of the series. The trend is the slowest-moving part of a series, the part representing the largest time scale of importance. In a time series of product sales, an increasing trend might be the effect of a market expansion as more people become aware of the product year by year.\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>Trend patterns in four time series.</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll focus on trends in the mean. More generally, however, a trend is any persistant and slow-moving property of a series -- time series commonly have trends in their variation or in the frequency of their outliers, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Moving Average Plots #\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what kind of trend a time series might have, we can use a **moving average plot**. To compute a moving average of a time series, we compute the average of the values within a sliding window of some defined width. Each point on the graph represents the average of all the values in the series that fall within the window on either side.\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A moving average plot illustrating a linear trend. Each point on the curve (blue) is the average of the points (red) within a window of size 12.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The moving average plot is meant to smooth over any short-term fluctuations in the series so that only long-term changes remain. For a change to be a part of the trend, it should occur over a longer period than any seasonal changes. To visualize a trend, therefore, we take an average over a period longer than any seasonal period in the series. For instance, if a time series had daily observations and an annual (yearly) seasonality, we would use a moving average with a 365-day window.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Time Dummy #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will model trend as a time-dependent property. When a property is time dependent, we can think of it as a function that takes time steps as inputs and produces the property as an output. To model time-dependent properties, therefore, we want to include time steps as a feature in our dataset. Such a feature is called a **time dummy**. A time dummy is essentially an ordinal encoding of the time index.\n",

    "When creating time series features, we can avoid a lot of tricky edge cases by using a library function instead of using Pandas directly. `DeterministicProcess` is a utility from the `statsmodels` library for creating time series features. It accomodates missing timestamps and can generate features for times outside of the training data (much like Prophet's `make_future_dataframe` we saw in Lesson 1). The `constant` argument creates a feature for the y-intercept of the graph, and the `order` argument creates a feature for the trend. \"Order\" here refers to polynomial order: 1 is linear, 2 is quadratic, 3 is cubic, and so on. The moving average plot suggests that the trend is close to linear, so we'll create a time dummy of order 1."
