    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few lessons, we'll use feature engineering to capture the temporal relationships we discussed in Lesson 1. In terms of feature engineering, features derived from:\n",
    "- the *time index* express *time dependence*\n",
    "- the *past series values* express *serial dependence*\n",
    "\n",
    "As time dependent properties, trend and seasonality we'll be able to model by creating encodings of the time index considered as a kind of categorical variable. Serial dependence we can model through *lag embeddings*, features created from past values of a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll pull these features together using `scikit-learn`'s `LinearRegression` to get an additive model somewhat like Prophet's:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "target = trend + seasonality + lag features + remainder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our choice of linear regression is mostly for simplicity and convenience. You could (with some limitations we'll discuss later) use these same features to make a forecaster out of almost any other machine learning model, like XGBoost or neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trend #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about trend. The **trend** of a time series is the long-term change in the mean of the series. A trend will often be driven by some kind of regular, persistant accumulation, like the <note>TODO: example</note>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a change to be part of the trend, it should occur over a longer period than any seasonal changes. For example, if a time series had a weekly seasonality, any trend would have to be a change over a period longer than seven days.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will require in addition that the trend be predictable purely from the time the observation was taken, that it should be a *time dependent* property of the series. This is to distinguish a trend (which should be predictable) from a merely random accumulation (which is not predictable).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img>Trend vs. random walk</img>\n",
    "\n",
    "<note>TODO: explain figure</note>\n",
    "\n",
    "A trend we should be able to extrapolate. Trying to extrapolate some kind of trend for the series on the right would not be successful, since future values are just as likely to go up as they are to go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand the distinction between a true trend and merely a persistent random accumulation because many time series (especially financial time series) that we would most like to forecast do appear to behave more or less as random walks, and we would be misled in attempting to forecast a trend. For a given time series, domain research can help you determine whether a trend might actually exist -- it may not be obvious from the series itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Moving Average Plots #\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make the trend in a series more apparent by averaging over the seasonal periods with a **moving average plot**. In a moving average plot, we compute the average of the values within a *sliding window*. Each point on the graph represents the average of all the points that fall within the window on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EZOXiPs.gif\" width=400, alt=\"An animated plot showing an undulating curve slowly increasing with a moving average line developing from left to right within a window of 12 points (in red).\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "To help isolate the trend, choose a window size at least as long as the longest seasonal period; this will help smooth over any seasonal effects. The series above has monthly observations and a yearly seasonality, so we chose a moving window of size 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "<note>TODO: explain animation more</note>\n",
    "\n",
    "When used for visualization, taking the average at the center of the window is best so the trend doesn't appear lagged. Moving averages are also sometimes used as features. In this case, you would want to take the average only of past values to avoid leaking information backward from the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Time Dummy #\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the trend depends only on time, we can model it with a time-step feature. Such a feature is called a **time dummy**, which is essentially an ordinal encoding for a column of timestamps:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Date    | Time |\n",
    "|---------|------|\n",
    "| 1959-06 | 1.0  |\n",
    "| 1959-07 | 2.0  |\n",

    "A time dummy implicitly includes all the timestamps within the range of dates of the time series, including missing values. Generally, this means that if your time series skips a date, your time dummy should skip the corresponding code. Above, the `Date` column skipped `1959-11`, so `Time` needed to skip `5.0`. This only applies to timestamps that are truly missing, however. Many financial time series only include business days, for instance, but we still wouldn't account for weekends or holidays in the trend because we assume nothing happened then.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend in a time series can manifest itself in curves with a variety of shapes. Two simple trend patters, linear and quadratic, are displayed here:\n",

    "When creating time series features, we can avoid a lot of tricky edge cases by using a library function instead of using Pandas directly. `DeterministicProcess` is a utility from the `statsmodels` library for creating time series features. It accomodates missing timestamps and can generate features for times outside of the training data (much like Prophet's `make_future_dataframe` we saw in Lesson 1). The `constant` argument creates a feature for the y-intercept of the graph, and the `order` argument creates a feature for the trend. \"Order\" here refers to polynomial order: 1 is linear, 2 is quadratic, 3 is cubic, and so on. The moving average plot suggests that the trend is close to linear, so we'll create a time dummy of order 1."
