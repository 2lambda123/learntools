    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson and the next, you'll learn how add trend and seasonal components to any machine learning model through feature engineering. This lesson is about modeling trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trend #\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trend** of a time series is a long-term change in the mean of the series. For a change to be part of the trend, it should occur over a longer period than any seasonal changes. For example, if a time series had weekly seasonality, any trend would have to be a change over a period longer than seven days.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we require that the trend should depend only on the time the observation was taken, that it should be a *time dependent* property of the series and not a serially dependent property. This is to distinguish a trend (which should be predictable) from a purely random accumulation (which is not predictable).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img>Trend vs. random walk</img>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Moving Average Plots #\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make the trend in a series more apparent by averaging over the seasonal periods in a **moving average plot**. With a moving average plot, we compute the average of values within a *sliding window*. Each point on the graph represents the average of all the points that fall within the window on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EZOXiPs.gif\" width=400, alt=\"An animated plot showing an undulating curve slowly increasing with a moving average line developing from left to right within a window of 12 points (in red).\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a window size at least as long as the longest seasonality in the series. This helps to isolate the trend by smoothing over any seasonal effects. The series above has monthly observations and a yearly seasonality, so we chose a moving window of size 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "<note>TODO: explain animation more</note>\n",
    "\n",
    "When used for visualization, taking the average at the center of the window is best so the trend doesn't appear lagged. Moving averages are also sometimes used as features. In this case, you would want to take the average only of past values to avoid leaking information backward from the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trend Models #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll create features that capture important temporal patterns, and use scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` model to combine these features into an additive model very much like Prophet's.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "target = trend + remainder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the trend depends only on time, we can model it by using a time-step feature in our training data. Such a feature is called a **time dummy**, which is essentially an ordinal encoding for a column of timestamps:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Date    | Time  |\n",
    "|---------|-------|\n",
    "| 1959-06 | 1.0   |\n",
    "| 1959-07 | 2.0   |\n",
    "| 1959-08 | 3.0   |\n",
    "| 1959-09 | 4.0   |\n",
    "| 1959-11 | 6.0   |\n",
    "| ...     | ...   |\n",
    "\n",
    "A time dummy implicitly includes all the timestamps within the range of dates of the time series, including missing values. Generally, this means that if your time series skips a date, your time dummy should skip the corresponding code. Above, the `Date` column skipped `1959-11`, so `Time` needed to skip `5.0`. This only applies to timestamps that are truly missing, however. Many financial time series only include business days, for instance, but we still wouldn't include weekends or holidays in the trend because we assume nothing happened then."

It accomodates missing timestamps and can generate features for times outside of the training data (much like Prophet's `make_future_dataframe` we saw in Lesson 1).
