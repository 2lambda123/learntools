    "# What is Seasonality? #\n",
    "\n",
    "Like trend, seasonality is a kind of time dependence sometimes present in time series that describes a changing mean, and, like trend, we will model it as being completely predictable as a function of time (as being *deterministic*, that is).\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a time series exhibits **seasonality** whenever there is a regular, periodic change in the mean of the series. Seasonal changes generally follow the clock and calendar -- repetitions over a day, a week, or a year are common. Seasonality is often driven by the cycles of the natural world over days and years or by conventions of social behavior surrounding dates and times.\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many time series have multiple seasonal components. Website visits, for instance, might rise and fall regularly over the course of a day and over the course of a year.\n",

    "# Seasonal Plots and Seasonal Indicators #\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we used a moving average plot to discover the trend in a series, we can use a **seasonal plot** to discover seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seasonal plot shows segments of the time series plotted against some common period, the period being the \"season\" you want to observe. The figure shows a seasonal plot of the daily views of Wikipedia's article on *Trigonometry*: the article's daily views plotted over a common *weekly* period.\n",

    "\n",
    "To help bring out a *yearly* pattern in the *Trigonometry* series, let's plot the series with the daily views summed into a monthly total. (Both Pandas and Seaborn have methods that make this easy.)\n",

    "**Seasonal indicators** are binary features that represent seasonal differences in the level of a time series. Seasonal indicators are what you get if you treat a seasonal period as a categorical feature and apply one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By one-hot encoding days of the week, we get weekly seasonal indicators. Creating weekly indicators for the *Trigonometry* series will then give us six new \"dummy\" features. (Linear regression works best if you drop one of the indicators; we chose Monday in the frame below.)\n",

    "The figure above shows the periodogram of the *Wiki Trigonometry* series. Agreeing with our seasonal plots, we see a strong weekly seasonality, as well as an annual (yearly) seasonality with three intermediate fluctuations; these intermediate fluctuations appear as the large bar between *Semiannual* (two times a year) and *Quarterly* (four times a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fourier features\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to seasonal indicators, we can use \"Fourier features\" to model these frequencies directly. The idea is to include in our training data periodic curves having the same frequencies as the seasonal components we are trying to model; specifically, we use curves of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fourier features** are pairs of sine and cosine curves, one pair for each frequency in the seasonal component starting with the longest. Fourier pairs modeling annual seasonality would have frequencies: once per year, twice per year, three times per year, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bKOjdU7.png\" width=600, alt=\"A top figure and a bottom figure, each showing a sine curve and a cosine curve. The curves in the top plot both have frequency of once per year, while the curves in the bottom plot both have a frequency of twice per year.\">\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add a set of these sine / cosine curves to our training data, the linear regression algorithm will figure out the weights that will fit the seasonal component in the target series. The figure illustrates how linear regression used four Fourier pairs to model the annual seasonality in the *Wiki Trigonometry* series.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AqPMnVx.png\" width=800, alt=\"\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center><strong>Top: </strong>Curves for four Fourier pairs, a sum of sine and cosine with regression coefficients. Each curve models a different frequency. <strong>Bottom: </strong>The sum of these curves approximates the seasonal pattern.</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we only needed eight features (four sine / cosine pairs) to get a good estimate of the annual seasonality. Compare this to the seasonal indicator method which would have required hundreds of features (one for each day of the year). By modeling only the \"main effect\" of the seasonality with Fourier features, you'll usually need to add far fewer features to your training data: this means reduced computation time and less risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing fourier features (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how Fourier features are computed isn't essential to using them, but if seeing the details would clarify things, the cell hidden cell below illustrates how a set of Fourier features could be derived from the index of a time series. (We'll use a library function from statsmodels for our applications, however.)"
