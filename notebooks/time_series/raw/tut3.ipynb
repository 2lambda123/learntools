    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to discover seasonality in a time series with *seasonal plots* and *periodograms*, and how to add seasonality to a regression model with two kinds of seasonal features: *seasonal indicators* and *fourier features*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like trend, seasonality is a kind of time dependence sometimes present in time series that describes a changing mean, and, like trend, we will require that it be predictable as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, a time series exhibits **seasonality** whenever there is a regular, periodic change in the mean of the series. Seasonality is often driven by the cycles of the natural world over days and years or by conventions of social behavior surrounding dates and times. Temperatures and animal populations rise and fall over the course of a year; store sales rise and fall from weekend to weekday.\n",
    "\n",
    "<note>TODO: seasonality intro image</img>\n",
    "<img>Seasonality</img>\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call \"seasonality\" often corresponds to the literal seasons of the year, but these periodic effects can happen on any time scale. Earth's ice ages tend to recur in periods of 100,000 years, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Seasonal Plots and Seasonal Indicators #\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we used a moving-average plot to visualize the trend in a series, we can use a **seasonal plot** to discover seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seasonal plot shows segments of the time series plotted against some common period, the period being the \"season\" you want to observe. The figure shows a seasonal plot of the daily views of Wikipedia's article on *Trigonometry*: the article's daily views plotted over the period of a week.\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "To help bring out a yearly pattern in the *Trigonometry* series, now let's plot the series with the daily views summed into a monthly total. (Both Pandas and Seaborn have methods that make this easy.)\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>When a period contains a large number of observations (like days in a year), aggregating observations through a sum or an average can help make any seasonal patterns more prominant.</center></figcaption>\n",

    "\n",
    "You might be familiar with *categorical plots* <note>link to dataviz</note>. The seasonal plot shows the series factored over the category of seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal indicators** are binary features that represent seasonal differences in the level of a time series. Seasonal indicators are what you get if you treat a seasonal period as a categorical feature and apply one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By one-hot encoding days of the week, we get weekly seasonal indicators. Linear regression works best if you drop one of the indicators. (We chose Monday in the frame below.) Creating weekly indicators for the *Trigonometry* series will then give us six new \"dummy\" features:\n",

    "Because of their ability to approximate periodic patterns, fourier features have an advantage over seasonal indicators. An annual seasonality occuring over days would need hundreds indicators, one for each day of the year. You might be able to model the same pattern with only 10 to 20 fourier features -- though the representation might theoretically only be approximate, having fewer features also means your algorithm will be less prone to overfitting.\n",
