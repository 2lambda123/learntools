    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've learned how to use the following clauses: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT ... \n",
    "    FROM ...\n",
    "    (WHERE) ...\n",
    "    GROUP BY ...\n",
    "    (HAVING) ...\n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned how to use aggregations like COUNT().\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll learn how change the order of your results using the ORDER BY clause. You'll also see how to work with dates in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY is usually the last clause you'll put in your query, since you're going to want to use it to sort the results returned by the rest of your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example on this familiar table. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/QRgb4iL.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordering by a numeric column\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reorder this with the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY ID\n",
    "\n",
    "The results look like\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/zEXDTKS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Ordering by a text column\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also order by text columns, and alphabetical order is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY Animal\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/E7qjnf9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reversing the order\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reverse the sort order (reverse alphabetical order for text columns or high to low for numeric columns) using the **DESC** argument (it is short for 'descending')\n",
    "\n",
    "This query sorts the selected columns by the Animal column, but the values that are last in alphabetic order will be returned first.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ID, Name, Animal\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "    ORDER BY Animal DESC\n",

    "### Dates\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's talk about dates, because they come up very frequently in most databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways that a date can be stored in BigQuery: as a DATE or as a DATETIME. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **DATE** format has the year first, then the month, and then the day. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    YYYY-[M]M-[D]D\n",
    "* YYYY: Four-digit year\n",
    "* [M]M: One or two digit month\n",
    "* [D]D: One or two digit day\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DATETIME** format is like the date format... but with time added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day. You can do this with the EXTRACT. \n",
    "\n",
    "This query will return one column with just the day of each date in the column_with_timestamp column: \n",
    "\n",
    "            SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp)\n",
    "            FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is very smart about dates and we can ask for information beyond just extracting part of the cell. For example, this query returns one column with just the week in the year (between 1 and 53) of each date in the column_with_timestamp column: \n",
    "\n",
    "            SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM column_with_timestamp)\n",
    "            FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has a lot of power when it comes to dates, and that lets you ask very specific questions using this information. You can find all the functions you can use with dates in BigQuery [on this page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql), under \"Date and time functions\".  "
