    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can select raw data, you're ready to learn how to group your data and count things within those groups. This can help you answer questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "* How many of each kind of fruit has our store sold?\n",
    "* How many species of animal has the vet office treated?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you'll learn about three new techniques: **GROUP BY**, **HAVING** and **COUNT()**. Once again, we'll use this made-up table of information on pets. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/fI5Pvvp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# COUNT()\n",
    "\n",
    "**COUNT()**, as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we **SELECT** the **COUNT()** of the `ID` column in the `pets` table, it will return 4, because there are 4 ID's in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/Eu5HkXq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**COUNT()** is an example of an **aggregate function**, which takes many values and returns one. (Other examples of aggregate functions include **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, and **MAX()**.)  As you'll notice in the picture above, aggregate functions introduce strange column names (like `f0__`).  Later in this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the name to something more descriptive.\n",
    " \n",
    "# GROUP BY\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUP BY** takes the name of one or more columns, and treats all rows with the same value in that column as a single group when you apply aggregate functions like **COUNT()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we want to know how many of each type of animal we have in the `pets` table. We can use **GROUP BY** to group together rows that have the same value in the `Animal` column, while using **COUNT()** to find out how many ID's we have in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/tqE9Eh8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns a table with three rows (one for each distinct animal).  We can see that the `pets` table contains 1 rabbit, 1 dog, and 2 cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "# GROUP BY ... HAVING\n",
    "\n",
    "**HAVING** is used in combination with **GROUP BY** to ignore groups that don't meet certain criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "So this query, for example, will only include groups that have more than one ID in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/2ImXfHQ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only one group meets the specified criterion, the query will return a table with only one row. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Which Hacker News comments generated the most discussion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to see an example on a real dataset? The Hacker News dataset contains information on stories and comments from the Hacker News social networking site. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with the `comments` table and begin by printing the first few rows.  (_We have hidden the corresponding code. To take a peek, click on the \"Code\" button below._)"
