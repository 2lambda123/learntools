    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned how to use these clauses in your queries: \n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ... \n",
    "    FROM ...\n",
    "    (WHERE) ...\n",
    "    GROUP BY ...\n",
    "    (HAVING) ...\n",
    "    ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this, your queries are getting pretty long, which can make them hard understand (and debug).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are about to learn how to use AS and WITH to tidy up your queries and make them easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# AS\n",
    "\n",
    "**AS** lets you refer to the the columns generated by your queries with different names, which is also know as \"aliasing\". (Similar to how Python uses `as` for aliasing when doing imports like `import pandas as pd` or `import seaborn as sns`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **AS** in SQL, insert it right after the name of the column you select. Here's an example of a query **without** an **AS** clause:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp), data_point_3\n",
    "        FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "And here's an example of the same query, but with **AS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "        SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp) AS day,\n",
    "                data_point_3 AS data\n",
    "        FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "Both of these queries will return the exact same table, but in the second query the columns returned will be called `day` and `data`, rather than the default names of `_f0` and `data_point_3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WITH... AS\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, **AS** is a convenient way to make your code easier to read and tidy up the data returned by your query. It's even more powerful when combined with **WITH** in what's called a \"common table expression\" or CTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Common table expression**: A temporary table that you return within your query. You can write queries against the new table you've created. CTE's only exist inside the query where you create them, so you can't reference them in later queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "CTE's are helpful for splitting your queries into readable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll revisit the pets table, but now it includes information on the ages of all the different animals. These are in a column called \"Years_old\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/01s9TwR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to ask questions about older animals in particular.  So you can start by creating a CTE which only contains information about animals more than five years old like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # note that this query won't return anything!\n",
    "    WITH Seniors AS \n",
    "            (\n",
    "                SELECT ID, Name\n",
    "                FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "                WHERE Years_old > 5\n",
    "            )\n",
    "This creates the following temporary table that you can then refer to in the rest of our query, which only has the ID and Name of the animals that are seniors:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/LBippKL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted additional information about this table, you could write a query under it. So this query will create the CTE shown above, and then return all the ID's from it (in this case just 2 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    WITH Seniors AS \n",
    "            (\n",
    "                SELECT ID, Name\n",
    "                FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "                WHERE Years_old > 5\n",
    "            )\n",
    "    SELECT ID\n",
    "    FROM Seniors\n",
    "    \n",
    "You could do this without a CTE, but if this were the first part of a very long query, removing the CTE would make it much harder to follow."
