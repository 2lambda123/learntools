    "# What are pipelines?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipelines** are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized.  Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "1. **Cleaner Code:** Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy.  With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training (_and validation_) data at each step.\n",
    "2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale.  We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "4. **More Options For Model Testing:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. For now, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have train_X, test_X, train_y and test_y. "
