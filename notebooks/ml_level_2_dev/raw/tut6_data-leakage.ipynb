    "# What is data leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data leakage** is one of the most important issues for a data scientist to understand. If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in the most subtle and dangerous ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "poor generalization, and overestimated performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of leakage: **leaky predictors** (aka target leakage) and **leaky validation strategies.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leaky predictors\n",
    "This occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| `got_pneumonia` | `age` | `weight` |  `male` | `took_antibiotic_medicine` | ... |\n",
    "|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n",
    "|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n",
    "|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n",
    "|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "People take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. So the raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns. But `took_antibiotic_medicine` is frequently changed **_after_** the value for `got_pneumonia` is determined. This is target leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would see that anyone who has a value of **`False`** for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia.  Validation data comes from the same source, so the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when we use this model to make new predictions, that data won't be available to the model.\n",

    "## Leaky validation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split.  The end result?  Your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines.  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!\n",

    "Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data is a first step, and pipelines can help implement this separation.  Leaking predictors are a more frequent issue, and leaking predictors are harder to track down. A combination of caution, common sense and data exploration can help identify leaking predictors so you remove them from your model.\n",
