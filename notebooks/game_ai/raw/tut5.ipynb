    "Halite is an online multiplayer game created by Two Sigma.  In the game, four participants command ships to collect an energy source called **halite**.  The player with the most halite at the end of the game wins.\n",

    "# Game strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a ship has two options at its disposal for collecting halite.  It can:\n",
    "- collect (or mine) halite from its current position.\n",
    "- collide with an enemy ship containing relatively more halite in its cargo.  In this case, the ship destroys the enemy ship and steals its cargo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are illustrated in the figure below.  The \"cargo\" that is tracked in the player's scoreboard contains the total cargo, summed over all of the player's ships.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises some questions that you'll have to answer when commanding ships:\n",
    "- Will your ships focus primarily on locating large halite reserves and mining them efficiently, while mostly ignoring and evading the other players?  \n",
    "- Or, will you look for opportunities to steal halite from other players?  \n",
    "- Alternatively, can you use a combination of those two strategies?  If so, what cues will you look for in the game to decide which option makes the most sense?  For instance, if all enemy ships are far away and your ships are located on cells containing a lot of halite, it sense to focus on mining halite.  Conversely, if there are many ships nearby with halite to steal (and not too much local halite to collect), it makes sense to attack the enemy ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also have to decide how to control your shipyards, and how your ships interact with shipyards.  There are three primary actions in the game involving shipyards.  You can:\n",
    "- convert a ship into a shipyard.  This is the only way to create a shipyard.  \n",
    "- use a shipyard to create a ship.\n",
    "- deposit a ship's cargo into a shipyard. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are illustrated in the image below.\n",

    "\n",
    "With more ships and shipyards, you can collect halite at a faster rate.  But each additional ship and shipyard costs you halite: how will you decide when it might be beneficial to create more?"
