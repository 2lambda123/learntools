    "- collide with an enemy ship containing relatively more halite in its cargo.  In this case, the ship destroys the enemy ship and steals its cargo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are illustrated in the figure below.  The \"cargo\" that is tracked in the player's scoreboard contains the total cargo, summed over all of the player's ships.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2DJX6Vt.png\" width=70%><br/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises some questions that you'll have to answer when commanding ships:\n",
    "- Will your ships focus primarily on locating large halite reserves and mining them efficiently, while mostly ignoring and evading the other players?  \n",
    "- Or, will you look for opportunities to steal halite from other players?  \n",
    "- Alternatively, can you use a combination of those two strategies?  If so, what cues will you look for in the game to decide which option is best?  For instance, if all enemy ships are far away and your ships are located on cells containing a lot of halite, it makes sense to focus on mining halite.  Conversely, if there are many ships nearby with halite to steal (and not too much local halite to collect), it makes sense to attack the enemy ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also have to decide how to control your shipyards, and how your ships interact with shipyards.  There are three primary actions in the game involving shipyards.  You can:\n",
    "- convert a ship into a shipyard.  This is the only way to create a shipyard.  \n",
    "- use a shipyard to create a ship.\n",
    "- deposit a ship's cargo into a shipyard. \n",
