As a new feature based on customer demand, your team has been planning to add the AI-powered ability for a single video camera to automatically track a presenter, focusing on them as they walk across the room or stage, zooming in and out automatically and continuously adjusting lighting and focus within the video frame. \n",

    "* _Simple Zoom_ is intended to be used for automatic zoom, focus, and lighting adjustment in the real-time video recording of individual presenters by a single camera\n",
    "* _Simple Zoom_ is not suitable for presentations in which there is more than one presenter or for presentations in which the presenter is partially or fully hidden at any time\n",

Given the information in the Intended Use section of the model card, what problem do you foresee for these customers if you integrate _Simple Zoom_ into _Presenter Pro_? What are some ways in which you could address this issue?"
