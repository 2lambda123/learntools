# Author username usually gets set in track_meta.py. The following optional key will overwrite
# the author for kernels generated under this particular config. (Example use case: author A
# is working on notebooks originally authored by author B. The default 'production' notebooks
# should keep their original slugs under author B's namespace. But if author A wants to push
# new testing versions of the notebook, they can set author: author_A in testing.yaml to generate
# new versions of the kernels under their own username.
