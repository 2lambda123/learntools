    "In the first statement we assign data to temporary variables, creating new ones as we go further and further along. In the second statement, written in the method chaining style, we instead \"chain\" our operations, one after the other, all on the same original `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most `pandas` operations can written in a method chaining style, and in the last couple years or so `pandas` has added more and more tools for making these sorts of statements easier to write. This paradigm comes to us from the R programming language&mdash;specifically, the `dpyler` module, part of the \"Tidyverse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Method chaining is advantageous for several reasons. One is that it lessens the need for creating and mentally tracking temporary variables. Another is that it emphasizes a correctly structured interative approach to working with data, where each operation is a \"next step\" after the last. Debugging is easy: just comment out operations that don't work until you get to one that does, and then start stepping forward again. And it looks kind of cool. =)\n",
