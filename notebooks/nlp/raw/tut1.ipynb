English  stopwords include \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"but\", \"not\". With a spaCy token, `token.lemma_` returns the lemma, while `token.is_stop` returns a boolean `True` if the token is a stopword and `False` otherwise."

For example, if you want to find where different smartphone models show up in some text you can create patterns for the model names of interest. First you create the `PhraseMatcher` itself."
