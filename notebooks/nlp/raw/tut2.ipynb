In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a text classification model with SpaCy. The classifier will be trained to detect spam messages. This is a very common use and spam detectors run in the background of nearly all email clients these days."

    "\n",
    "For each document, we count up how many times a term occurs. We place that count in the appropriate element of a vector.
