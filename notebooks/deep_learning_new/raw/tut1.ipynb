    "Welcome to Kaggle's *Introduction to Deep Learning* course! You're about to learn all you need to get started building your own deep neural networks. Using Keras and Tensorflow you'll learn how to:\n",
    "- create a **fully-connected** neural network architecture\n",
    "- apply neural nets to two classic ML problems: **regression** and **classification**\n",
    "- train neural nets with **stochastic gradient descent**, and\n",
    "- improve performance with **dropout**, **batch normalization**, and other techniques\n",

    "The tutorials will introduce you to these topics with fully-worked examples, and then in the exercises, you'll explore these topics in more depth and apply them to real-world datasets.\n",

    "<mark><b>TODO: What is a \"neural network\" and what does it mean in the context of a course on deep learning?  Currently missing: [1] definition of neural network so user can understand \"neuron\" as part of \"neural network\", [2] the idea of that neural network maps inputs to outputs (to set us up for understanding single neuron as doing the same).</b></mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the simplest and most basic part of a neural network -- a single neuron.  As a diagram, a **neuron** (or **unit**) with one input looks like:\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is `x`. Its connection to the neuron has a **weight** which is `w`. Whenever a value flows through a connection, you multiply the value by the connection's weight. For the input `x`, what reaches the neuron is `w * x`. A neural network \"learns\" by modifying its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `b` is a special kind of weight we call the **bias**. The bias doesn't have any input data associated with it; instead, we put a `1` in the diagram so that the value that reaches the neuron is just `b` (since `1 * b == b`). The bias enables the neuron to \"shift\" its output independently of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `y` is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. To get the output, the neuron sums up all the values it receives through its connections. This neuron's activation is `y = w * x + b`, or as a formula $y = w x + b$.  \n",

I moved \"house prices\" here so that the input could come from a feature from that dataset, and then you can identify \"y\" as the intended output</b></mark>\n",
