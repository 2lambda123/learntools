    "# The Linear Unit #\n",
    "\n",
    "A single neuron with one input looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d8rXmAr.png\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Diagram of a linear unit.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>The Linear Unit\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading this diagram think about the computation as flowing from left to right. The numbers on the connections we call **weights** and the values that flow from input to output we call **activations**. Notice that this neuron has a constant input of 1 attached; its connection has a special weight called the **bias**. This neuron has two weights, `w` and `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule is that whenever an activation flows through a connection, you multiply it by the weight, and to get the output of the unit you just sum up all of the inputs. So, this unit computes a function like $y = w x + b$, or in Python `output = w * input + b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example #\n",
    "\n",
    "Say the weights on our neuron happened to be `w=3` and `b=2`. What would we get if we plug in `x=-4`?\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ihh7iaj.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Diagram of neural computation.\">\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Which checks with our formula: $y = 3(-4) + 2 = -10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(By the way, running all of your training data through a network like this is sometimes called doing the *forward pass*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Linear Unit Fits a Line #\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the problems we'll work in this course will be *curve-fitting* problems. Given some data-points, we want to draw a curve that runs through the points as close as possible. These are also called **regression** problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of curve does a linear unit fit? Does the formula $y=w x + b$ look familiar? It's an equation of a line! It's the slope-intercept equation, where $w$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. That's why we call it the *linear* unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9crcufH.png\" width=\"700\" alt=\"On the left, training data points with a line placed at random. On the right, the same data points with the line running through the middle.\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center><strong>Left: </strong>The untrained linear unit. <strong>Right: </strong>The trained linear unit.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "When first created, a neuron has its weights set randomly. The goal of training is to find values for the weights that fit the curve. For our linear unit, we're trying to find the best slope $w$ and y-intercept $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple Inputs #\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to fit a curve to more than one input? That's easy enough. We can just add more input connections to the neuron. To find the output, multiply each input to its connection weight and then add them all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mgncuD1.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Three input connections: x0, x1, and x2, along with the bias.\">\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for this neuron would be $y = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b$. A linear unit with two inputs will fit a plane. (And one more more inputs than that will fit a *hyperplane*!)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear Models in Keras #\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, you can create a model with a single linear unit using what's called a `Dense` layer. Most neural networks are built by stacking layers of neurons that connect in a nparticular way, which we'll learn about in Lesson 2. (Stacking layers is what `Sequential` does.)"
