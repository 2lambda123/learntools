    "\n",
    "One simple model could work as follows:\n",
    "- Each house costs at least \\\\$60K (or 60 thousand dollars).\n",
    "- Each bedroom adds \\\\$40K to the price of the house.\n",
    "- Each bathroom adds \\\\$30K to the price of a house.\n",

    "- Each house costs at least \\\\$100K.\n",
    "- Each bedroom (and each bathroom) adds \\\\$10K to the price of the house. \n",
    "- Each additional bedroom above three bedrooms adds $50K to the value of the house.\n",

    "In the figure above, \"ReLU\" refers to the **Rectified Linear Unit** function, which sends converts negative values to zero (and leaves positive values alone).  In other words, it is the function $f(x) = \\max(0, x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "- A house with one bedroom and one bathroom costs \\\\$120K (or \\\\$100K + 2 * \\\\$10K).\n",
    "- A house with four bedrooms and three bathrooms costs \\\\$220K (or \\\\$100K + 7 * \\\\$10K + (4-3) * \\\\$50K).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is similar to the previous model, with one key difference: we no longer calculate price directly from the input (number of bedrooms and bathrooms).  Instead, we have introduced some intermediate calculations that let the model capture more complex patterns.  This is the main idea behind neural networks."

    "- The **output layer** is the final layer of the network.  It outputs the value that we'd like to predict (for example, the price of a house).\n",
    "- The **hidden layers** are all of the layers between the input and the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in a neural network is assigned a number that dictates how the value in one unit is passed to a unit in the subsequent layer.  These numbers all called **parameters** (or **weights**).  All of the figures in this tutorial depict different examples of neural networks; you can see examples of how parameters are used in a neural network above.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a neural network, the parameters are initialized to random values.  Then, during training, the neural network learns how to encode the parameters to accurately map input values (such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms) to output values (such as house price).  In the remainder of this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a neural network.  Then, in the next tutorial, you'll learn how to train it."
