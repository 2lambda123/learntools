    "Each agent is implemented in a function that accepts two arguments: `obs` and `config`.\n",
    "- `obs` is a Python dictionary containing the current state of the game, and it is updated at each turn.  \n",
    " - At the beginning of the game, it is always `{'board': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'mark': 1}`.  `mark` is set to `1`, to denote that player 1 always goes first.  The code then runs the `agent1` function to have player 1 to select a column. \n",
    " - Then, if player 1 places a disc in column 7, it becomes `{'board': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 'mark': 2}`. \n",
    "    - `board` has been updated to have a `1` in the spot where player 1 selected a disc. \n",
    "    - `mark` is now `2`, since it is player 2's turn, and the code runs the `agent2` function to get player 2 to make a move.\n",
    " - In general, the value for `board` is a Python list showing the locations of the discs, where the first row appears first, followed by the second row, and so on. We use `1` to track player 1's discs, and `2` to track player 2's discs.\n",
    " - While the agent that always selects the middle column completely ignores the board, the random agent uses `obs.board` to determine which moves are valid.  In particular, if the top position (i.e., highest row) for a column is empty, then the column is valid.\n",
    "- `config` is a Python dictionary that describes the environment settings.  If using the default Connect Four environment, it is `{'columns': 7, 'rows': 6, 'inarow': 4}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent returns an integer with the selected column, where indexing starts at zero.  So, in the case of 7 columns, the returned value is one of 0-6, inclusive.\n",
