    "# 1. The Data Science of Shoelaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Nike has hired you to improve help save some of the money they've spent on unneeded shoe materials. Your first assignment is to help a data scientist who has built a model to predict how many shoelaces they will need each month. The features going into his model included:\n",
    "- What month is it (January, February, etc)\n",
    "- Advertising expenditures in the previous month\n",
    "- Various macroeconomic features (like the unemployment rate) as of the beginning of the month\n",
    "- The amount of leather they ended up using that month\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show the model is almost perfectly accurate if you include the feature about how much leather they purchased. But it is only moderately accurate if you leave that feature out. You realize this is because the amount of leather they use is a perfect indicator of how many shoes they produce, which in turn tells you how many shoelaces they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think the `leather` feature constitutes a source of data leakage?"
