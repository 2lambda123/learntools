    "All of the maps you will create in this course portray the surface of the earth in two dimensions.  But, as you know, the world is actually a three-dimensional globe, and so we have to use a special method, called a **map projection**, to render it as a flat surface.  In general, no map projection can ever be 100% accurate.  Each projection distorts the surface of the Earth in some way, while retaining some useful property.  For instance,\n",
    "- the *equal-area* projections (like \"Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area\", or \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\") preserve area.  This is a good choice, if you'd like to calculate the area of a country or city.\n",
