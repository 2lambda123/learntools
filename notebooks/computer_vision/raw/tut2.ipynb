    "To be efficient, a neural network needs a structure that reflects the problem it is trying to solve. Modern neural networks have been designed to solve complex problems, and their architectures have become complex as a result. Designing a network around modular components like we have in this lesson makes managing this complexity much easier. (It is a kind of object-oriented design for neural networks!)\n",

Having composable blocks makes it easier to design a network to suit your need."
